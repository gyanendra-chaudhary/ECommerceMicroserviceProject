# 🛒 Microservices E-Commerce Project with .NET

## 📘 Introduction

This project is created **for learning purposes only**.

The goal is to understand and practice building an **e-commerce application** using a **Microservices architecture** with **.NET**. It serves as a hands-on way to explore key microservices concepts such as service separation, inter-service communication, API gateways, and containerization using modern .NET technologies.
